## üíº Work Experience

### AWS, GCP, and Azure DevOps Tech Lead ‚Äì Softtek  
*March 2025 ‚Äì Present*  
At Softtek, I orchestrated multi-cloud infrastructure assessments across AWS, GCP, and Azure to support large-scale migration initiatives. My role involved embedding best practices in security, scalability, and cost optimisation while acting as a bridge between Development, QA, and Infrastructure teams. By translating business needs into actionable technical solutions and monitoring execution, I ensured seamless delivery. I directed junior engineers, promoted stakeholder alignment, and fostered a culture of continuous improvement, accelerating project outcomes and strengthening DevOps adoption.

### Senior Azure DevOps Engineer ‚Äì Epicor Software  
*November 2022 ‚Äì March 2025*  
At Epicor, I led enterprise-level migration projects to Azure Kubernetes Service, improving scalability, resilience, and governance of workloads. I modernised delivery pipelines by migrating from Jenkins to Azure DevOps and Azure DevOps to GitHub Actions, and coordinated artifact migrations from Bitbucket to GitHub Enterprise.  

I implemented infrastructure as code (Terraform, Bicep, ARM) with automation scripts (PowerShell, Bash), improving consistency, security, and deployment speed. I resolved pipeline failures, embedded monitoring and alerting, and introduced improvements that reduced risk and accelerated time to market.  

I led AKS optimisation in Microsoft-assisted performance labs and contributed to VM optimisation, driving measurable performance gains. Additionally, I mentored junior engineers, strengthening team capability and DevOps maturity.
